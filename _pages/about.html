<p>I'm a PhD student in computer science at Boston University, advised by <a href="https://www.mvaria.com/">Mayank Varia</a>. I'm interested in cryptography and its applications for society, public policy, and government. I did my undergrad at Oregon State University in computer science and math. While there, I was fortunate to have worked with <a href="http://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~rosulekm/">Mike Rosulek</a>, <a href="https://engineering.oregonstate.edu/people/rakesh-bobba">Rakesh Bobba</a>, and <a href="https://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~bennethu/">Huck Bennett</a>.</p>

<p>I also serve on the cryptography advisory board for <a href="https://www.projectcallisto.org/">Project Callisto</a>, a nonprofit building tools to help survivors of sexual assault.</p>
